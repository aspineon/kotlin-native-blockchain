# kotlin-native-blockchain

This is not building/compiling!

Compile
--------

Run these commands to prepare the `setup.sh` file for you and add the submodule `kotlin-native`:

    chmod +x ./setup.sh
    ./setup.sh

After all, go to directory `src` and run:

    chmod +x ./setup.sh
    ./setup.sh

It will compile the source for you and create the `.kexe`.

To run this `.kexe`, simply run:

    ./Main.sh
